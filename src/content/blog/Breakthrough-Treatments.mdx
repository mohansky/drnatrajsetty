Heart failure affects nearly 6.2 million Americans, but recent medical advances are transforming treatment options and outcomes. Our clinic is proud to offer several cutting-edge therapies that weren't available even five years ago.

SGLT2 inhibitors, medications originally developed for diabetes, have revolutionized heart failure management. These drugs reduce hospitalization rates and mortality in patients with reduced ejection fraction, even those without diabetes. Our specialists are experienced in integrating these medications into comprehensive treatment plans.

Minimally invasive valve repair techniques now allow us to treat structural heart problems without open-heart surgery. The MitraClip procedure, for example, repairs leaky mitral valves through a catheter-based approach, offering hope to patients previously considered too high-risk for surgical intervention.

Remote monitoring technology enables our team to detect subtle changes in your condition before symptoms worsen. Implantable devices and smartphone-compatible wearables provide continuous data, allowing for proactive adjustments to your treatment plan.

If you or a loved one is struggling with heart failure, schedule a consultation to learn if these innovative approaches might be right for you. Our multidisciplinary team stays at the forefront of cardiac care to provide you with the most effective treatment options available.
