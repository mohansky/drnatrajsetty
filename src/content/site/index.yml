      treatment: Cardiac checkup - General
      comments: Very professional approach by the doctor. Went for a check up since I had chest pain. He did an ECG, ECHO and TMT and reassured me that my heart is fine. I am very happy with the doctor. His support staff especially Nanditha are also excellent. Also need to add that his fees and other charges are reasonable. Highly recommended.
